# Intro

Hello! I am a Senior Engineer at McKinsey & Co, where I do client-facing development work for clients across numerous industries. Previously, I was an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Business Administration. I'm interested in Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks, Full-Stack Web Development, and Mobile Development. Please don't hesitate to reach out!

I am originally from Los Altos Hills, California. I have since lived in Berkeley and currently live in New York City.
